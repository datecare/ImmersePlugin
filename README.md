# Immerse Plugin

ImmersePlugin is a very chaotic Minecraft Plugin whose goal is to transform the vanilla Minecraft Survival experience 
by adding whatever suggestion sounded like a fun idea at the time.

Built for 1.21.1, tested up to 1.21.4

## Dependencies

Sadly, it was built integrated in Intellij Idea, which was good enough, so I haven't done Gradle/Maven to make it easier to build

Dependencies used:

1. Spigot: spigot-api-1.21.1-R0.1-20240919.212816-30-shaded.jar

2. Essentials: EssentialsX-2.21.0-dev+151-f2af952.jar

3. Gson: gson-2.11.0.jar

## Economy System

- Currency the player can get for doing stuff like mining, killing, farming
- Player trade system (not fully functional)


## Jobs

- Players can choose jobs which specialize in some parts of gameplay

- Players can level up in their jobs by doing job-specific tasks

- Job-specific shops exist, allowing players to get items other can't have or at least not easily

- As you level up your jobs, you unlock job-specific skills (for example, one of the skills of farmers is breaking every connected crop with one click)

- Jobs include:

	**Hunter**
	
	**Miner**
	
	**Farmer**
	
	**Adventurer**


## Commands

- Some QOL commands are implemented like:

1. /msg <player>

2. /spawn

3. /addhome

## Balance

- Balance is a key factor, who wants to play on a survival server where you can get stacks of diamonds in 30 mins?

1. Ore (especially diamond) drop rate decreased a lot, making getting Fortune a must-have

2. You can not use an enchanting table until you get enough money to unlock the option, postponing enchantment mania

3. Some mobs like Wither Skeletons can spawn stronger, strength indicated by armor and sword.

4. Villager trading is disable (for now, looking into ideas to make it work in a fun balanced way)

5. Some other secret stuff

## Achievements

- Players can get custom achievements by playing. (We are yet to implement all the achievements)

- Achievements are categorized into:
1. Basic - tells you what to do
2. Advanced - doesn't tell you what to do (you only see the name)
3. Expert - you only get a hint (not even the name)

- Achievements give the players score

- Players can share their achievements in global chat.

## Chaos

- Weird encounters and events in the world

## Future plans
- Custom Ender Dragon battle
- Tokens for accessing End
- Player factions / teams
- Whatever falls on my mind
